## Creating Custom APIs 

In order to create a custom API you must first select the Team page you will be working with. After selecting the ‘API’ tab. There are two other sub tabs within the API tasb that you can experiment with later but for now we will be walking through the ‘Custom API’s’ tab.

 In the top left corner, please select the big blue ‘Add’ button. You will see a drop down with the option to create a ‘Custom API’ (second from the bottom).

If you recall how you created your first API on Terminal, the process is quite similar. When selecting the ‘Create New Custom API’, you will see the below empty template to start your customization process. The information you needed before submitting is:

1. API Name 
2. URL 
3. Description (optional) 
4. Preloaded Contracts 
5. Code

Once all of the above inputs are set, you are can go ahead and submit your new custom API.

Once you have submitted your API, it will appear right below the ‘Create New Custom API’ bar. For example, we created a new custom API titled ‘ToadLicker’ and you can see how it will appear on your page once you have submitted it to the platform (pictured below, highlighted in red).
