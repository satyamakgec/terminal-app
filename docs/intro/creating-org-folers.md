Next, you will click “Create” and your folder should be created! You are now free to further organize the folder by adding other contracts, wallets and documents within it. You will see your folder show up on the Overview dashboard (as displayed below):

If you would like to further organize your folder structure, click on the folder you just created to start adding objects within it. As pictured below, you can now start creating additional folders within your folder.
