## Creation

When creating a web3 hook on the platform, you must first navigate to the “My Terminal” button. You will then be directed to the below page. As you can see, there are a few different option tabs at the top. Please click on the ‘Web3 Hooks’ tab to get started with the creation of your first web3 hook.

Note: If you have not yet uploaded a contract ABI, you will likely need to do so before being brought to the above page. From this page you are free to start inputting the details of your webhook.

After filling out details such as:

1. Input URL
2. Output (Example)
3. Parameters (contract parameters)
4. Etc..

Click ‘Submit’ to have it saved on the Web3 Hooks page. An example follows of both the inputted details of a web hook and then final result of submitting it (below the details section):

You have now successfully submitted your first Web3 Hook to your Terminal Portal!

Note: You of course also have the ability to edit and delete your webhooks.

### Web Hook Activity Tab
