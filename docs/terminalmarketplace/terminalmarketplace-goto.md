## The dApp Marketpalce

The Terminal Marketplace is the go-to place for dApp projects to encourage open source contributions to their work. By making your project public on the marketplace, you open up your team’s terminal page for the public to engage and contribute to. As you can see below, the projects are displayed in cards on the main dashboard. As a user, you also have the ability to “star” your favorite projects to make it easier to contribute and view their work. This is the future of open source! 


**Project view:** When users click on a company page, it brings them to the following view. The project dashboard is a mirror image of your home “My Terminal” dashboard. This allows users to click through and contribute to your team’s folders, objects and everything you have made publicly available.

Before external users can start contributing to your project, you first need to make it public to the community. Let’s get started by walking you through the process. On your projects homepage, navigate to the ‘Settings’ tab. This tab will allow you to customize your page and open it up to the public. While we are here, feel free to change your team’s information (profile photo, name and project URL). Notice at the bottom, there is a ‘Members’ box with all of your team members listed with their contact information. Next, let’s click the ‘Switch to Public’ button. As you can see in the below right image, a pop up will appear on your screen confirming that you indeed want to make your profile public. Please read the disclaimer before proceeding.

You will then be prompted to sign with your Terminal password in order to proceed (as pictured below).

Now that your profile is public, we can further customize your page for the marketplace and for general public view. As pictured in the below left picture, you can go in and fill out the following ‘Marketplace Display Settings’: 

1. Cover Photo
2. Project Description 
3. Logo

In the below left hand picture, you can see an example of what your finished profile can look like to the public.
