When prompted to sign transaction you have multiple options with the Terminal platform. You have a choice of signing with your own wallet, whether that be using a MetaMask, Nano Ledger, Terminal’s special Terminal Key or even delegating the signature to another person.

### I. Sign a transaction with your own wallet

When clicking ‘Select’, you have a few options to choose from when signing with a wallet.

**Note:** MetaMask and other wallets are also available for the transaction signatures displayed above but are not documented here. Please make a request in our community support section if you have any trouble getting through the transaction signature process.

## II. Requesting a team member to sign your transaction (When an already existing signatory signs for the ID)

**Sending a request to a team member**

Step 1: When prompted with the ‘Confirm & Sign’ popup, you can send the transaction to someone else by click ‘Send’ icon in the bottom left corner of the popup page.
