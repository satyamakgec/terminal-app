## Welcome to Terminal

The first step to get started with Terminal is to create an account. To start, please navigate to [Terminal](https://terminal.co). You will be prompted to login (or create an account) as displayed in the below example.

Once you have created your account or logged-in you will arrive at your home screen dashboard displayed below.

Before we get into the details of the platform, let us first walk you through the high-level features of your account. In the top right corner, you can see there are three buttons

Starting from the right-hand side, you will see two options, an account management button and a logout button.

The account button essentially gives you the freedom to customize and change your account settings to suit your preferences.

Next, we have the notifications button which will simply be the go-to place to let you know about any new additions or edits to your projects. Notifications can include events such as adding new folders, team members adding you to projects, etc.. the list goes on.

Lastly, we have the dApps button. As displayed on the right, you can see that the dApps button triggers a drop-down menu with additional features. The drop-down menu consists of five different features:

1. Notifications

- Activity Notifications from the dApps that you are currently working on

2. Address Book

- Your address book will include all members of your teams and developers who have collaborated with you. You also have the ability to import your existing contact from email or your device to make it easier for you to collaborate.

3. The Gas Station

- The Gas station is a feature that allows you to decide if you want to cover the gas costs that your dApp users will incur when using your dApp. There are also additional features that can allow you to allocate funds (crypto/credit/debit) into a pooled account to pay off all the accrued gas costs at once (add more here..)

4. Web 3 Hooks

- In short, Web 3 Hooks are what you will need to connect your smart contracts to your front-end. There will be an entire section dedicated to this later on.

5. Permissions

- The permission section allows you to grant permission to other developers or team members to collaborate with you on specific tasks and projects. We will also be getting into more detail about permissions in later sections of the documentation.
