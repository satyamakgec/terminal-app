## Terminal APIs 

In order to get a grasp of how the API management works within Terminal, let us first walk you through the process of creating an API. Just like when you created your Web3 Hook, you must first navigate to the “My Terminal” button. You will then be directed to the below page. Please select the ‘API’ tab to get started with the creation.

Note: If you have not yet uploaded a contract ABI, you will likely need to do so before being brought to the above page. From this page you are free to start inputting the details of your API. 

**After filling out details such as:**
1. URL 
2. cURL
3. Input (Example)
4. Output (Example) 
5. External Calls checkbox
6. Transaction 
7. Other parameters

Click ‘Submit’ to have it saved on the API page just as you did before with the creation your webhook.
