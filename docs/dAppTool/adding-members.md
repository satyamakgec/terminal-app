To add new members (also referred to as signatories) or wallets to you ID, you will first have to select the ID you want to work with. Once you are within the ID, you can now navigate to it’s ‘Permissions’ tab.

In order to add new wallets or IDs to your ID, you can select the blue highlighted button titled ‘Add Signing Method’ at the bottom of your permissions tab page.

 For the sake of this walkthrough we will be adding Daniel’s Wallet. Feel free to select or add any signing method that you want to work with. 

Once selected, it will appear like the other Signing methods you have under your ID. However, it is not official until you officially apply the changes. Please select the ‘Apply’ button to do so (below):

 After selecting the ‘Apply’ button you will be brought to the ‘Confirm & Sign’ popup page to finalize your changes. Sign with the correct signatory of your ID and deploy your changes to your Terminal. There it is, you have successfully added an additional wallet to your ID as a signatory.

  Note: As you can see in this case, we selected a ‘restricted’ function and that requires an ID that has the specific permissions to sign with it. Luckily, we will be covering this in the next step.
