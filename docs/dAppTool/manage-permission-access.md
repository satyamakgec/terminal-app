In order to manage specific permissions-access for functions within your contracts, you must first select the contract that you want to set up. From the contract dashboard, please navigate to the ‘Permissions’ tab, right next to the ‘Code’ tab. Below you will see a list of the functions within your contract.

Above you can see that there is a manager of the permissions for this function (ie; Joseph ID). Note that this is not permanent and that you can change the ERC-725 ID at any time by clicking on the current Joseph ID card. 

### Setting Permissions for a function

After selecting the contract that you want to set function permissions for, you will see an already filled list of members who have access to the contract with either a ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ next to their name.

  For the purpose of this walkthrough example, let us change all of the member’s permissions to ‘Yes’ (pictured below). Once you have done so, please proceed by click ‘Continue’:

After clicking “Continue” the edited Function will be highlighted in blue and the “Sign” button will turn blue ready for action. Keep in mind the User can still edit more Function Permissions before signing.

  Once you are finished with the permission changes, navigate to the bottom of the above page and select ‘Apply’ to initiate a transaction to confirm you changes.

  Confirm and then deploy for your changes to be saved for your contract and function permissions.
