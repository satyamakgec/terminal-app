## Adding your ID to your contract

In order to add a contract to a specific ID, you must first select one of your IDs from your main Terminal Dashboard and then click on the ‘Permissions’ tab. 

From the permissions tab, you may add a new set up permissions for this contract by selecting ‘Setup Permissions’ (below):

 You may select a already existing ID to manage the contracts permissions or you can also go through the process of creating a new identity for management purposes. 


Once the ID has been selected, you will need to confirm and sign on the following screen:

 Once the transaction has been approved, you will see that the ID you have selected to manage the contract’s permissions has been officially set on the right side of the top of the permissions tab bar. You can change the ID/Owner of your contracts by selecting ‘Change ID/Owner’ in the bottom right hand side.
