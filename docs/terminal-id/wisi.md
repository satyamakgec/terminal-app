## Activate WiSi (Wireless Sign-in / Delegated Sign-in)

Let’s walkthrough the set up of your WiSi signing method for your ID. As displayed below, in order to enable the ability to use WiSi for signing transactions you must first navigate to the ‘Permissions’ tab of your ID dashboard. From the ‘Permissions’ tab, you have the ability to add ‘Signing Methods’ for your ID. As seen below indicated by the red arrow, this is where you will enable your ID’s WiSi. In order to test this out for your own account, click on the ‘Add Signing Method’ and then search for your own WiSi. Once you are done, click ‘Continue’ to finalize the process.

## Sign a Transaction using WiSi

Signing a transaction with WiSi isn’t much different than signing a transaction with another method. Once the transaction is initiated, you will see the typical ‘Confirm & Sign’ page below:

The big difference here is that instead of selecting a hardware wallet or a browser wallet, you select to sign the transaction with your Terminal wallet. Once selected, click ‘Continue’ to move to the next step to officially verify and sign the transaction with WiSi.

2. Next, you will be prompted to enter your Terminal password and hit ‘Sign’

3. The last step is to confirm that this is in fact your WiSi by giving the final sign off with your the Two-Factor Authentication.

4. The final confirmation should appear on your screen in the form of a green checkmark as seen below:

5. You will then be brought back to the original contract page you were on when submitting the original transaction that you just signed for. In the top right corner of the page you will see a ‘Transaction Tracker’ which will flow through 3 verification steps before officially confirmed:

1. Broadcasted
1. Mined
1. Confirmed

The progress tracker will also provide details such as:

- A hyperlink to your transaction hash
- Progress status of your transaction
- Age of the outstanding transaction
- Time until the transaction is estimated to be confirmed
