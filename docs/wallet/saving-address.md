The Terminal platform aims to make the lives of its users easier. Throughought the platform, there are many tools to make your life easier. For this section, Terminal built tool to make interacting with repeated addresses easy. Instead of having to find an address each time you want to send a transaction, you can save an address from a past transaction to your address book for the next time you want to transaction with said address. 

As seen below, there is an activity list of all the transactions that have occured within your Terminal. In order to start the process of saving an address for the future, you are going to have to click on that little purple address book within the listed transaction (reference the arrow in the below image)

After clicking on the little purple address book, you will see a pop up box with some more  detailed information about the address that you recently transacted with such as the hyperlink to the transaction and to the contract.

The last and final step before your contract is added to your address book is to enter some information about your contact. The address should already be inputted within the Address section, so all you need to do now is put the name down for your contact and then select ‘Add’.

Below, you can now see that the contact has successfully been stored in your address books memory. If you look at the original transaction that we worked with, the once written address from the transaction is now written as ‘John Dev’.
