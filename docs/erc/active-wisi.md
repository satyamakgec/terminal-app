Let’s walkthrough the set up of your WiSi signing method for your ID. As displayed below, in order to enable the ability to use WiSi for signing transactions you must first navigate to the ‘Permissions’ tab of your ID dashboard. From the ‘Permissions’ tab, you have the ability to add ‘Signing Methods’ for your ID. As seen below indicated by the red arrow, this is where you will enable your ID’s WiSi. In order to test this out for your own account, click on the ‘Add Signing Method’ and then search for your own WiSi. Once you are done, click ‘Continue’ to finalize the process.
