## 

In order to create your first ERC-721 Identity, you must navigate back to the home dashboard and click on the same “Add” button as you did when you added your smart contract and your wallet.

To reiterate, the next step is to create your ID. There are three categories that need to be filled out before creating the identity. It requires: 

1. ID Name
2. Network
3. ID Admin Address (Make sure you have full ownership of this address)
