Before deploying your ID to the network, you must first decide what wallet you want as your signatory for the ID you are creating. Select from the wallet IDs within your address book or add a new one. Once you have finished this step, click ‘Deploy’ to officially create your ID.

The last and final step is the ‘Confirm & Deploy’ page that will allow you to confirm all the information that you have entered during your ID creation plus the additional transaction details (ie; costs) of the ID deployment to the Ethereum mainnet. After everything looks to be correct, proceed by clicking the ‘Deploy’ button (as pictured below) to finalized the creation of your ID.
